# Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)

This repository contains my undergraduate dissertation in Applied Psychology.  
The project explored how ACEs shape long-term resilience and social support systems, with an emphasis on welfare, adaptation, and differential plasticity.  

While focused on human psychology, this research reflects my broader interest in welfare-related questions.
